# Assignment 3

I chose the IC3 Complaint Statistics 2014-18 visualization on page five of the FBI 2018 Internet Crime Report.

# Assignment 3; Critique
My critique of the visualization is posted on the Google Form.

The use of a globe in the visualization was something new and gave a different take at viewing the Complaint Statistics. However, the globe combined with the way the years and aggregate counts and monetary amounts were laid out were not clear. It took a bit too much time to figure out that the numbers represented different things and to separate them from each other though they were shown in different typefaces. Though the arrows helped separate between Total Complaints and Total Losses and followed the overall color scheme of the report, they were not aesthetically pleasing to look at. I would change the entire way the numbers are shown, perhaps in a simple bar chart or line graph, perhaps with a double axis.

The primary audience seems to be stakeholders or even sponsors within the FBI, who may be interested in the the impact that the IC3 unit has had in identifying and dealing with internet related crimes. I think the visualization on PG. 5 does not do the best job in showcasing overall Complaint Statistics for 2014-2018. The idea of scattering stats across a globe was original but it overall the visual looks outdated and dull. The numbers are difficult to discern and it takes time to figure out that two different numbers are being shown, years and aggregates. The people reading this report initially will most likely be busy so it would be better to make the data visualization as simple and clear as possible to help identify trends easily.

I would retain the blue, green, grey color scheme of the visualization to fit with the rest of the report. However, I would remove the globe completely, especially since the majority of the report focuses on statistics aggregated from the US and place the stats in a simpler bar or line graph for ease of discerning trends.

I decided to change the entire visualization into a line graph with a doubel axis, one denoting the Total Complaints and the other the Total Losses derived from the count of complaints. It made send to compare the two variables on the same graph thought they certainly oculd have been done separately. I retained the associated colors, blue for Total Complaints and green for Total Losses, both for their respective axis and actual plotted points and lines, to make it easy for viewers to literally connect the dots and understand that both variables were related. The x--axis featured the years 2014 to 2018. Writing up the scales for the double y-axes was actually the most challenging part of the wireframe as I wanted to stay true to the values represented in the original visualizations but wanted to ensure my comparisons were not misleading. Ultimately, the values for Total Complaints spanned 0- 400,000 and that of Total Losses ranged from $0 to $2,200 million.
