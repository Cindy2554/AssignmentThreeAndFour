# Assignment 3

I chose the IC3 Complaint Statistics 2014-18 visualization on page five of the FBI 2018 Internet Crime Report.

# Assignment 3; Critique
My critique of the visualization is posted on the Google Form.

The use of a globe in the visualization was something new and gave a different take at viewing the Complaint Statistics. However, the globe combined with the way the years and aggregate counts and monetary amounts were laid out were not clear. It took a bit too much time to figure out that the numbers represented different things and to separate them from each other though they were shown in different typefaces. Though the arrows helped separate between Total Complaints and Total Losses and followed the overall color scheme of the report, they were not aesthetically pleasing to look at. I would change the entire way the numbers are shown, perhaps in a simple bar chart or line graph, perhaps with a double axis.

The primary audience seems to be stakeholders or even sponsors within the FBI, who may be interested in the the impact that the IC3 unit has had in identifying and dealing with internet related crimes. I think the visualization on PG. 5 does not do the best job in showcasing overall Complaint Statistics for 2014-2018. The idea of scattering stats across a globe was original but it overall the visual looks outdated and dull. The numbers are difficult to discern and it takes time to figure out that two different numbers are being shown, years and aggregates. The people reading this report initially will most likely be busy so it would be better to make the data visualization as simple and clear as possible to help identify trends easily.

I would retain the blue, green, grey color scheme of the visualization to fit with the rest of the report. However, I would remove the globe completely, especially since the majority of the report focuses on statistics aggregated from the US and place the stats in a simpler bar or line graph for ease of discerning trends.



# Assignment 4; Wireframe I
[Link to Initial Wireframe](HW4_Wireframe1.jpg)

I decided to change the entire visualization into a line graph with a doubel axis, one denoting the Total Complaints and the other the Total Losses derived from the count of complaints. It made send to compare the two variables on the same graph thought they certainly oculd have been done separately. I retained the associated colors, blue for Total Complaints and green for Total Losses, both for their respective axis and actual plotted points and lines, to make it easy for viewers to literally connect the dots and understand that both variables were related. The x--axis featured the years 2014 to 2018. Writing up the scales for the double y-axes was actually the most challenging part of the wireframe as I wanted to stay true to the values represented in the original visualizations but wanted to ensure my comparisons were not misleading. Ultimately, the values for Total Complaints spanned 0- 400,000 and that of Total Losses ranged from $0 to $2,200 million.

# Assignment 4; Interviewee Critique

*Interviewee 1: Spouse*

1. Can you tell me what you think this is?
A graph about complaint statistics (literally read the title). But did not know from where and in what context.

2. Can you describe to me what this is telling you?
The graph is showing total complaints between the years 2014-18 and then total losses fo rthe same time frame. Interviewee wasn't completely clear on the relationship between the two, however.

3. Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?
Was suprised to see that Total complaints were rising steaduly in the time range where Total Losses began to skyrocket. Was curious to know what happened during this time.

4. Who do you think is the intended audience for this?
Interviewee stated for decisoin makers in the FBI. This was pretty accruate after I explained that the data came from the Internet Crime Unit of the FBI.

5. Is there anything you would change or do differently?
They suggested making the axis title and overall graph title more detailed so that viewers know exactly what everything is wothout it having to be explained. Suprisingly they did not thave a problem interpreting the double axis which I was concerned about.



*Interviewee 2: Sibling*

1. Can you tell me what you think this is?
A chart describing incidences of complaints.

2. Can you describe to me what this is telling you?
The chart shows total complaints and total monetary losses between the years 2014 and 2018. (Seemed to have gotten the relationship quicker especially since I did not say anything about the data.

3. Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?
She was confused about how monetary losses grew so quickly compared to totla complaints. It seems like seeing the green line shoot up past the blue line and into the white space really caught both interviewees attention.

4. Who do you think is the intended audience for this?
This interviewee said either government officials or the general public. Very close.

5. Is there anything you would change or do differently?
They also stated that more explicit title would be helpful and a source caption. Agian, I was suprised that the double axis did not throw my interviewees off and did not initimidate them.

# Assignment 4; Wireframe II

[Link to spreadsheet used](HW3_IC3_Spreadsheet.xlsx)

I decided to use Tableau software to digitally visualize my inital wireframe and incorporated the changes mentioned by my interviewees. I made the main title and axes titles more explicit so that the readers could infer the relationship between the dual axis quicker. The main difference with my Tableau iteration is that the scales get cut off earlier, so you won't see the Total Losses line shooting past the Total Compalints line, but I believe that the point that monetary losses are increasing at an alarming rate due to internet crimes is made clear. Also, the I was not able to make the axis change color according to the lines represented by them, but intuively, it seem spossible to figure out which line is associated with a particular axis. I ultimately stuck with the line graph because I and my interviewees felt that a compariosn could be made easily.
